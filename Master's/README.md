# Master's submission

The final code for the part of my master's submission titled "A machine learning model, trained on synthetic data generated in Blender, that detects car interior damage using images taken on a smartphone."

The current repo contains the python scripts and PBS job scripts for (1) generating the synthetic data and (2) training, testing and validating the machine learning models. Also included are the final trained models described in my thesis. Models include an RNN, CNN and AlexNet.

The PCA augmentation (as described in the AlexNet paper) can be found in ```Model dev/ AlexNet/ AlexNet_augmentation.py```.
